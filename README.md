# tumblr

Ruby wrapper and command line tool for the [Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api). In case there wasn't enough of those. This one is powered by the [Weary](http://github.com/mwunsch/weary) gem.

## Installation

	gem install tumblr-rb

## Goals

+ Full API coverage. Leave no method behind.
+ Well tested
+ Obnoxiously simple CLI.
+ Kind-of-sort-of proof-of-concept for Weary.
